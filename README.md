This repository contains an analysis of Uber pickup data to understand how various factors such as weather conditions, holidays, and days of the week influence the number of pickups. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

The goal of this project is to analyze Uber pickup patterns and identify factors that impact the demand for Uber rides. This analysis includes:
- The effect of weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, visibility, snow depth) on Uber pickups.
- The impact of holidays and weekends on the number of pickups.
- The variation in pickups across different days of the week and seasons.
